How to Run?
You need python3 with pygame module installed on it. (You can install it using pip).
Just Run main.py and Enjoy the Game.

Rules of Game:
Rules of Game can be better understood from Internet but here are short Rules:
You need to capture your Opponent Pieces.
To capture the opponent Peice you need to move over it diagonally.
You can move diagonally each time but for capture the opposite diagonal square must be empty.
You can make 1,2 or 3 ... Captures in a move.
When a player's all pieces are captured or the player cannot make a move he loses.

What have I done?
First I implemented a 2 player version of game:
You click on your piece. It shows you all possible moves. And you make a move.
Second I implemented "game.py" module so that a "player" and be substituted with AI. A kind of Abstraction you can think of.
Finally I implemented minimax Algorithm to play the game from AI side. Further I assume it can be optimized with alpha-beta pruning.

For Description of code refer to Diagram

Further Work: I think of Optimizing it by using Alpha-beta Pruning. 

Speed Test: With depth of calculation at 3 the moves performed by AI are almost instantaneous.
At depth 4 they take a few second, but at Depth of 5 it takes way much longer.
I implemented alpha-beta pruning at the end but in my experience the simple minimax algorithm performed better. 
With the implementation of alpha beta pruning the moves were expectedly faster at depth 5.
